# ZipMC

A small plugin that zips your Minecraft worlds.

## Background
The popular server host `Minehut` removed their ability to download multiple filed or folders at once for free, leaving many free tier users wanting to download their worlds unable to do so.

This plugin aims to fix this. By compressing your world into a ZIP archive (which is technically only one file), you are able to download your worlds without paying Minehut.

## Usage
This plugin is very simple to use, as you do not even have to open Minecraft.
<ol>
  <li>Download the plugin ando upload it to Minehut in your plugins directory</li>
  <li>Restart your server</li>
  <li>Look into the home folder of your server. There should be a file called "world-compressed.zip". Download this file and extract it</li>
  <li>Enjoy your world!</li>
</ol>

### Advanced usage
If you want to download a world that has a different name from the default name `world`, you need to go into the `config.yml` and change the `world-name` to your world's name. 
Then, you have to restart your server and then stop it. You can then download your ZIp file from the file manager.
